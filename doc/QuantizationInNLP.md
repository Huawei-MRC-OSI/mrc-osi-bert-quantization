  * The codebook trick can give an alternative approach to [memory layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05242)
* [Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651)
  * Impressive results, but may reflect Word2Vec being not so good more than quantization being good
  * Need to investigate applications to more up-to-date embeddings
